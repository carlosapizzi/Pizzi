<summary> How I got in love with cooking </summary>
<p>Since I was a little kid I went every summer to Orlando to my Grandma's house. </p>
<p>My Grandma used to pick me up every day and sat me on the kitchen table and would try to teach me a new recipe.  </p>
<p>Every day I would try to cook with her and that's when I started loving the kitchen.  </p>
<p>She surprised me with different types of dishes; lunch, dessert, supper. This made me really exited.</p>
<p>The last time I went to her house I made her some of her rice and beans and she was very suprised on how close they tasted to hers.<p>
<p> Fun fact... Thanks to her I only know how to cook for more than 4 people I can't make a dish for one pearson.<p>
<p> So now you know a little about my story.<p>
